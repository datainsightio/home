## About Us

We are a small group of angel investors based in London investing in early stage technology companies. Collectively we are experienced across product management, finance, recruitment, compliance and marketing. 

We are ‘hands-on by default’ investors and look to allocate our time as well as capital to all deals to ensure we can maximize the chance of success for all shareholders. If your looking solely for passive investors then we would not be a good fit. 

## Portfolio and Exits.

We have invested in the following companies since 2016:

[Logical Glue](https://www.logicalglue.com) -- Exited July 2019.

Weswap. 

NorthRow. 

Livesmart.


## What we look for in a startup

We recognize that seeing early signs of an outlier is hard, and nobody’s cracked how to do it reliably. What we want is a reason to tell ourselves that a startup has a chance to be extraordinary. There are a few areas where we search for signs: certain qualities of a founding team, an early product, areas where we think we can be helpful, and the right moment in a company’s life.  Here is a [complete list](https://github.com/Bloomberg-Beta/Manual/blob/master/3%20-%20Criteria%20for%20investing.md) of the questions we ask ourselves when evaluating startups. 

### Founders

We look for a reason to believe a founding team is extraordinary. Not that they have the perfect skills or experiences to match the business they want to build (which is where the “team” slide in the deck tends to focus), but that they have the capacity for greatness.

### “Themes”

Our focus is investing in startups that improve work -- and knowledge work in particular.

We have doubts about the effectiveness of theme-based investing. The best founders can surprise an investor with an unexpected take on a category. That said, there are areas our team has grown to care about and learn about. We only want to invest in companies where we believe we have enough understanding to be enormously valuable to our founders, and to have good enough judgment to support founders through thick and thin. 

[Machine intelligence](http://www.shivonzilis.com/machineintelligence) crosses all the areas we care about, and we have treated it as our main interest area for several years now. We believe machine intelligence will transform every industry and every function -- and we focus on its effects on business. We believe [machine intelligence will be like electricity](http://www.wired.com/2014/10/future-of-artificial-intelligence/): cheap, convenient, and on-demand. We want to back the founders ushering this future into the now.

Areas where we’ve invested include: content discovery, cybersecurity, data sets and services, developer tools, full-stack startups who use technology to compete in a new way, hardware, human-computer interaction, learning, media distribution, new organizational models, open source software, productivity tools, professional networks, real estate, technology platforms, workflow tools, workplace communication.

We avoid investments in financial services companies that intend to compete with Bloomberg clients.

Sometimes founders mistakenly assume that we avoid “consumer” companies entirely. There are many individual-facing businesses that we’d fund -- they just need to help a person at work. (Typically “enterprise” businesses sell to a company, and these individual-facing services sell to the end user directly.) Ask us if you are unsure if you fit in our scope!

We do avoid, for example, e-commerce and entertainment because they tend to serve people outside their work capacity. There are also other areas that intersect with the future of work where we know too little to be confident, e.g., retail, travel, local, heavy industry, and medical services. We also believe we play a role in how the future of work evolves, so we'll (politely) pass on investing in what may be highly successful companies but don't fit into a vision of a world we want to live in.

### “The Deck”

A demo is 50 times more useful than slides. One is a description of a thing, the other is the thing itself. We look at your demo [the way a new user would](http://also.roybahat.com/post/82904179747/why-most-demos-confuse).

We cringe at the idea of founders spending lots of time making fundraising presentations. When we see “v36” in the filename of a presentation, it bothers us. That said, we do value the work founders do writing down their plans for their company, because it gives us a sense of:
* How the team thinks
* How well the team communicates
* Whether, if we don’t know the team, we should spend the time to meet in person

If you use a presentation to sell your product to customers, we're as interested in that pitch as in your fundraising pitch.

There is no standard format we like, but we probably spend 2-5 minutes reading a deck when we are deciding whether to meet a company. How many slides? Depends, but if you need 20 detailed pages to tell your story, that's likely more than we can absorb.

In roughly one-fifth of our portfolio companies, we never saw a deck before investing -- usually because the product spoke so loudly for itself, or we knew the team and business so well we didn’t need a deck.

In some cases, where we know the team well, we’ve helped founders (even before we decide whether to invest) write their deck for other investors.

In day-zero companies, we don't pay much attention to your milestones -- if you are in the discovery phase, trying to figure out what works, you'll generally be unable to predict where you will be beyond two months from now.

We do care about what metrics you intend to track -- what experiments are you running, what hypotheses is your first product testing -- and if there is one metric you care about more than any other.

We also ignore, in most cases, long-term financial projections -- except to the extent that they show what the “unit economics” (revenue and cost from a single user or customer) need to be for the business to work. If you fail to invent assumptions that make the overall business wildly profitable in a few years, then you probably should be doing something else for a living.

That said, we do care about the short-term financial plan, especially on the choices founders directly control. How many people do you intend to hire, where will you spend the money? This helps us figure out how much time you will have before you need more capital, and how far we believe you can get in that amount of time. We prefer to see early-stage companies spending their capital on building product.

Put another way, a five-year financial plan is mostly useless for early stage companies -- a monthly plan for the next twelve months and a quarterly plan for the next two years could be very useful.

### In-person meetings

Once we’re meeting in person, you can often leave the laptop closed. We’re trying to get a sense of you as a founder, ask you hard questions and see how you respond.

If your product is public, you should assume when you walk into the room that we’ve spent the time to play with it.

Some things we tend to say, ask, or think in meetings:
* We don’t put great faith in the value of advice (including, often, our own) -- the world of users and customers has more to teach a company than any smart, well-intentioned person.
* What makes you an outlier? (Do you know what makes your company a potential outlier?)
* Why is this problem important to you, and how will things be better if you succeed?
* What was the last important skill you learned? (We believe great founders are, paradoxically, both self-confident and exceptionally good learners -- so constantly in need of improvement.) What was the last thing you were wrong about?
* What do you want out of your investors other than money? (We’re trying to figure out if we can be uniquely helpful.)
* If a dozen other companies are creating a company right now with this exact idea, how could you still succeed?
* Who will you pick as your [first customers](https://also.roybahat.com/picking-your-first-customers-the-gradient-of-influence-47858b90adfd)? (This tends to be, in our view, one of the most important early choices founders make.) Who was the last potential customer you spoke with? (Founders who are scared of talking to customers scare us.)
* How close do you feel you are to product-market fit? (Here, it's less that we want you to *have* product-market fit, and more that we want to understand how you think about your own progress wherever you are.)
* Are there any plans you really would like to pursue, but have stopped talking about with investors because you've been told by VCs they are bad ideas? (We often like those plans.)
* If you're successful, what potential harms might your service cause, and what will you do about that? What's been the most difficult ethical dilemma you've had at work? (Credit to our friends at [Designer Fund](http://designerfund.com) for putting in our heads some of these specific questions about the ethical side of startups.)
* For what values would you sacrifice making more money? In practice, have you sacrificed financially to live by a principle?
* How will you build a diverse and inclusive team over the next year? Given your personalities, what culture issues do you think are most likely to arise at your company?
* Why are you raising money at all? (We find there are plenty of startups who don’t actually need to raise money and, in general, that’s better for them -- even if it means we don’t get to participate.)

We try to avoid some of the, shall we say, less useful questions others ask:
* What will you do if [big scary company X] competes with you?
* Have you patented any of this?
* How does this become a $1B business?
* [How’s it going?](http://also.roybahat.com/post/62158854505/a-dumb-question-to-ask-an-entrepreneur)

Founders are sometimes surprised at how quickly our meetings move; we often will take you off your story to zero in on something we believe is a key driver. This is how we’d work with you after our investment, so you can think about whether you enjoy working with us.

At any point, we’d be happy to narrate for you our level of interest -- though you might not always like what you hear. (And remember, an 80% chance of wanting to work together still means there is a 20% chance we will not want to work together.)

Immediately after we meet, a frequent thing we need to do is just think on it -- if we find ourselves getting less excited a day or two later, that’s probably a bad sign. If we find ourselves returning to the conversation in our heads, wondering what you meant when you said such-and-such, and imagining how great the product will be, that’s a great sign.

A lot of founders wonder why investors are slow to get back to them. This is an unacceptable pattern, and yet one we’ve been guilty of from time to time. Sometimes, the reason is we’re doing work on your company (e.g., calling references, who might take a few days to get back themselves). Sometimes it’s that we’re unsure and we’re giving ourselves a few days to see if we get more excited or less as we think on it. Sometimes we just mess up and forget to reply. It’s a fail when that happens. We try to at least narrate as we go with “I know you haven’t heard from us in a few days, this is what’s happening…”

We aspire to be at the extreme end of the “we communicate openly with you” scale.


## The deal terms

We want founders to know what to expect when they work with us before they get to the first meeting, and understanding how we think about deal contracts is an important part of that process. So we have published the templates we use for our [investment documents](https://github.com/Bloomberg-Beta/Investment-Documents). We recommend reading the accompanying [blog post](https://medium.com/@hjs/were-open-sourcing-our-investment-documents-f96b6e8c40e5), that explains these documents.
### Rights we want

We care about getting pro rata rights. This means that if a founder offers another investor the opportunity to invest at a certain price, we want to invest at that price too -- at least up to the amount needed to preserve our ownership of the company.

We also want to approve of any investments you take that might get their capital repaid before ours.

We care about getting some information rights -- basically the ability for us to understand how well the company is doing, and its financials.

We go into much more detail in our public [explanation of our investment documents](https://medium.com/@hjs/were-open-sourcing-our-investment-documents-f96b6e8c40e5).

### The numbers

Our standard first check is $500,000, though more and more often we are investing up to $1M. We want to invest enough to give a startup the money it needs to make real progress in the early days, and to attract other investors alongside us if needed. We are happy to lead, and happy to participate in rounds led by others, depending on the situation -- in earliest-stage venture, sometimes the [idea of a lead means different things to different people](http://also.roybahat.com/post/119369807637/in-earliest-stage-venture-what-is-a-lead-anyway).

In the early days of our fund, we wrote smaller checks because (like the early days of companies) we believe in burning capital slowly until you find product-market fit. (In our first year, our biggest check was $250,000.)

We have no minimum check size, and have written checks as small as $25,000, especially in what we call a ["flag" investment](https://github.com/Bloomberg-Beta/Manual/blob/master/1%20-%20Manual.md#flag).

We care about price. We avoid having a hard requirement about our ownership percentage. That said, we want to get return on our time in addition to our capital, so we generally want to be able to own a meaningful amount of a company over time. A good rule of thumb for us is that meaningful ownership means roughly 10%. We are comfortable taking the highest possible levels of risk and we believe that founders, and their investors, should be rewarded for that. (We also believe companies are successful when their teams also get generous equity grants that motivate the early team members to create something valuable.)

We also believe “the price is the price” -- we won’t ask for unusual discounts for ourselves with strange terms like participating preferred equity. We are flexible as to whether our investment is structured as convertible debt or as equity. 

No, not every VC wants to own 30% of your company. In fact, we think at seed stages too much ownership by the early investors can ruin the cap table -- making it difficult for the founders to make money, or later investors to own enough of the company when the company needs bigger dollars to scale.

We believe in transparency. If a startup that takes our money wants to publicize the terms of our investment, we’d generally support that. (Of course we’d never disclose anything confidential without consent, and we expect the same of our founders.)

The average pre-money valuation of our recent investments was $7M, though the range was wide depending on the company's state (with valuations ranging from $2-15M. (We update this number from time to time, at a pace that avoids inadvertently disclosing the terms of any one deal. This average includes only investments where we were the first money into a company -- we lack a way to make our small number of later-stage investments comparable.)

While we’d like to claim that the amount of work we do on behalf of a company will vary dramatically based on our ownership interest, we’re not sure that is true yet -- the reality is that the amount of work we do for a company depends most of all on how much the company needs and wants our help. If they ask us to work for them, we do what we can to help.

### Other investors

We don’t care whether we are the lead investor or not. While we prefer to co-invest with others (who can help support a company in difficult times, and bring more expertise to bear), we have invested in situations where we are the only investor. We have also invested in situations where we own such a miniscule percentage of a company that it rounds to zero.

When we do co-invest, we care who a company’s other investors are, because the investors form an extended team around a company -- and we want our companies to have the best teams possible. We get concerned when we see situations with many investors, none of whom have a significant stake, because we worry that none will actually work to help the company.

### Negotiating

We can commit to terms on just a [handshake](https://www.ycombinator.com/handshake/) as opposed to a formal term sheet (which we're happy to write when founders want them).

We only want founders to hire us as their investor after careful consideration of the alternatives, with as full information as possible. So we're allergic to "exploding offers" (where proposed investment terms expire on a set date) -- in fact we have never made one. Investors and founders enter a marriage from which there is no divorce, so while it's important to choose quickly, it's also a one-way door and it's essential to choose well. 

### Following on

Because we have two relatively big funds (each of $75M) for writing modest initial checks, we do plan to devote an unusually large proportion of our funds' resources to following on. We will deploy our capital over the usual length of time for a fund: five years or so for all our initial investments, and then follow-on capital after that. We do not have a specific timetable for expected returns, one of the benefits of having a single LP with a long-term focus.

We won’t follow on in every investment, but if we are excited about putting in more money we might want to follow on for 5x our initial investment -- or more. That said, there will also be situations where a company evolves in a way where -- even though it is still a great company -- it would benefit more from another investor’s capital than from ours, so we might not always follow on in great companies.

We're happy to invest outside of what is typically considered "a round" -- there are some companies where we've invested multiple times in between more formal rounds.

If asked, we’re happy to be explicit about the conditions under which we’d ask to put more capital into a company. Generally, when a team's initial bets prove to be right...

### “Standard terms”

We believe investors should get a “1x liquidation preference” -- in other words, if the company ends up being worth less than the value that we invested at, we should be able to at least get our money back.

We want to protect your confidentiality and ours, and usually include a standard term to accomplish that -- though the best protection is trust.

## Our “products,” or, how we work with founders

We think of our “products” as offerings of support and capital to a company, and the price we charge is ownership in a company.

### “Seed”
Our preference is to be the first money into a company, and to contribute a meaningful amount of capital. This is the core of what we do, and it reflects roughly 90% of the dollars we invest. We want to be able to add capital, sometimes even increasing our ownership stake, as the company evolves. While we lack a specific ownership percentage target, we try to get meaningful ownership given the stage of the company -- in practice, this can be 5-15% depending on how far the company’s progressed. (It’s difficult to generalize because, in startups, exceptions are the rule. We also find that hard ownership targets can make it more difficult to form a syndicate with other investors who can be helpful.)

### “Flag”
In some cases, we only seek to put a small amount of money to work (for example, in rounds where the founder is fortunate to have many investors who want to support the company, or it is a later-stage company), and it is unlikely we will invest more. In these cases, our support is as much symbolic as it is financial -- we want to be part of something, even though we know it is unlikely to be an investment that is meaningful to our fund financially. A typical check for these investments might be $50K. While these investments have access to all the services we offer our portfolio, given our lower ownership stake we’re less able to pay proactive attention to these companies and we want to set clear expectations up front about what kinds of startups the founder will likely consider competitive.

## How we support founders

The founders we back are our customers. We aspire to be the most useful investors per minute spent with us, and per dollar on the cap table. We want founders to want to work with us even if we weren't investors offering them money. (Though, for us to be willing to advise, we'd need the same level of conviction that we have when we're willing to invest.)

We want to work with startups the way they work, not the way that big companies or traditional investors work. We prefer to take the formality out of the investor-founder relationship. Instead of requesting board seats and scheduling formulaic calls, we share with founders and encourage them to reach out to us when we can help. We've supported founders with everything from customer introductions to helping hire a critical new team member to sharing product feedback to thinking strategically about press. Consider us “on speed dial.” We try to cut waste out of the process; starting a company is hard enough. If you want regular check-ins, sure.

Our team works closely together -- we speak often and love helping each other, and we each know the full portfolio -- so every portfolio company has access to every member of our team. We think this is different to some other venture firms we’ve met -- we try to be a “no dysfunction” partner to you.

### Areas where we tend to be most useful

While we’re happy to help companies across the full range of early-stage company questions -- recruiting (how to seal the deal for a critical early hire?), fundraising (should I take more money or call it a day?), services (who do I use for HR?) -- we concentrate on the range of skills loosely called “going to market.” Our focus on the future of work means that we may know your market well, or your business model.

To us, going to market includes finding product-market fit, segmenting your market, sequencing your approaches to potential users or customers, pricing, understanding when to review and when to ignore the competition, using the various organic marketing tools, paid marketing, press, partnerships, planning to raise more capital, and just the overall understanding of the importance of communicating who you are and why you are. We have many views here that startups find surprising.

We bridge multiple professional worlds -- technical, financial, corporate, philanthropic, political, social, and otherwise. We try to bring founders across those bridges early and often, with introductions to leaders in any of those fields and group discussions to share ideas and lessons learned that are applicable to startups.

We have presence in both San Francisco and New York. We've found that SF-based founders appreciate introductions to customers in New York -- we can open that door. We make a concerted effort to help the transition from “west to east” and “east to west.”

We don’t care about face time -- you won’t get a “hey let’s have coffee just to catch up” every two weeks. We do spring into action when we see the Bat Signal. We take feedback from companies on what they want. Some of our companies have asked us to do monthly, or even weekly, meetings with them, others “go into hiding” while working on their product -- we’re good either way.

Because we sometimes create our own products, we stay current on tactical trends and may know them firsthand. If you're building something that we can use on our team, we'll share product feedback and be your biggest advocate. We believe founders have as much wisdom as investors (or more) -- we’re all just trying to spark something great in this big wide world.

One thing many founders don’t realize is how little direct control their investors ultimately have -- we can’t demand certain information from you unless it’s specifically written into our agreements (where we often ask only for general financial information), we won’t be able to make you hire or fire anyone -- we work with you based on mutual trust.

### How we like to communicate with you

It varies. In some cases most of our communication is by email and chat, others where we do a regularly-scheduled call, others where we meet in person from time to time -- it just depends on what the founder wants. At minimum, we generally like to know the number one thing we can help a company with at a given time so we can focus on that.

We appreciate getting regular investment updates (e.g., a monthly email) from companies we back, since it creates a background of good understanding that helps us help you. In practice, about two-thirds of companies we back are in this habit.

What makes a good written update for investors?
* A summary (sentence!) that helps us understand how you're doing at trying to accomplish the most important thing for your startup right now -- usually we think in terms of [the risks you're trying to address](https://also.roybahat.com/instead-of-a-business-plan-write-a-thesis-plan-6de9de59daaf)
* Usually, that means the one operational metric you believe tells the story of where you are, and how that metric changed since last time you communicated it (and relative to your expectations)
* What you’re most excited about now
* How you’re doing financially (cash left, burn)
* Team additions or changes
* Where you want help from us!

Here is a [sample anonymized update](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xykbjs0KnhdA2qYdvY_jm21QJdS35iETouNNe2nARJA/edit).

Even better than an update intended for investors is a passive way to keep us updated (i.e., something that requires no incremental work). If you send a weekly internal update, copying us is great; if you use a team collaboration tool (Slack, Trello, Telegram, a Skype chat, etc.) we’d love to be included and take it as a great sign of trust; we even subscribe to private Github repos.

### How to make the most of us

What gets us going is helping companies realize their potential. We are happiest when we are “in it” with you, introducing you to customers, helping close candidates, whiteboarding a set of features, pushing back on your plan to announce your fancy new product release, or getting that late night call that you think things aren’t working out with the person you just spent six months to recruit. We feed off your enthusiasm, and hope to help you build even more of it.

We intend to earn the trust of Bloomberg Beta founders. We commit to being available to you whenever you want to talk. We try to notice when it’s "a moment," and especially important to lead with empathy. We recognize that issues around the personal finances of founders are particularly important and often go undiscussed -- [something we would like to change, so we can better serve founders](https://medium.com/@roybahat/for-founders-and-investors-its-time-for-real-talk-about-money-b669ae467f92). We commit to treating founders' personal financial information, when they share it with us, with confidentiality and respect. We intend to use our knowledge to help you and your companies.

We also know startups are not all roses and sunshine, even for the best of companies. We aspire to be most helpful to you when times are tough.

Investing, to us, is really nothing more than the mechanism we use to find a way to work with you. We are more comfortable talking about new product launches than about how to optimize our allocation of capital across our portfolio.

### Events we host

We invite founders to many events. We believe one way we can help companies is just by getting them out of the building. We get our founders together every so often with an extended group of our friends, and with each other. Once founders start to see familiar faces, they understand that we're building a community of mutual support. These events are completely optional, and sometimes have no direct usefulness at all (like our monthly game of [Werewolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)) in San Francisco).

To bring worlds together, often we'll bring in an author, or a senior government official or business leader, or even an artist, to expose founders to ideas and people from outside the technology startup world. We invite portfolio company founders to every event, and some are only for them. When possible, we try to include the broader community in events we convene.

### Each other

Now that we have a critical mass of companies in our portfolio, the companies can be helpful to each other should they want to be -- vendor referrals, emotional support, product tips, etc.

We were one of the first (if not the first) fund to set up a portfolio community channel on Slack, even before Slack supported this functionality natively. Our founders congratulate each other, promote one another's successes, support each other through tough spots, offer tactical recommendations ("who should I use as an accountant?") in ways much more immediate, varied, and specific than our fund could do for any of them directly.

We noticed the conversations in that channel were surprisingly specific -- less about the big picture and more about what kind of paintbrush to use. We were inspired by the Picasso quote that only art critics talk about the Big Ideas, real artists help each other find [cheap turpentine](https://www.highly.co/hl/56e6f2323533356aeb5a0000). So we created an event series, "Turpentine Talks," where one of our founders who has expertise in a certain area (e.g., growth, building open source communities, hacking personal use of time) leads a roundtable discussion with other founders learning and offering their own experiences. 

We admire and want to continue to support these kinds of communities, that openly share a craft to hone the trade of companybuilding, with a particular set of companies that share a similar way of working and similar values. This kind of community is itself part of the future (and the past) of work done well.

### Learning

We recognize that founders don’t have the time to plan for their own professional growth and learning, so we offer them some of that. We might do a training on how to create useful communication with technical teams, or invite founders to a panel on a subject we think they might care about. Founders can [request](https://goo.gl/forms/qS1dehJQW5vFxYYs1) Turpentine Talks on topics of particular interest to them, of course.

### How our fund works with Bloomberg L.P.

We look for opportunities to connect startups (including our portfolio companies and others) with Bloomberg L.P. -- we invest significant time in understanding what Bloomberg may be interested in seeing. In practice, we refer more companies to Bloomberg that are not our portfolio companies, than are portfolio companies. And at the moment only one-fourth of our portfolio companies have business contact with Bloomberg. Bloomberg Beta would never be a party to a business relationship between a startup and Bloomberg L.P.; those relationships are all at arms’ length.

There are areas where access to Bloomberg may be enormously helpful to a startup. For example, some areas where Bloomberg has some of the best expertise in the world: the creation of a data-driven subscription business, selected technical specialties, high-touch customer service.

That said, we are set up as a separate legal entity to protect the confidentiality of startups with whom we work.

While Bloomberg will only work with your startup if it makes sense for Bloomberg (no, you can’t have a discount on a Bloomberg terminal), we understand how to facilitate the right conversation quickly.

We have an Advisory Committee at Bloomberg L.P. that hears from us about common themes we see, gives us input and feedback, and approves unusually big checks -- just like the LP Advisory Committee for any venture fund.

### After the exit...

We are disciplined about learning from every company. We will write up a retrospective report where we evaluate our value added to the team -- vs. what we wish we could have added. We assess whether we were right on the risks the company faced, and what lessons we learned. Most important, we ask whether the founder would have asked for our money again.

Capital that we earn will go back to Bloomberg L.P., and therefore to [Bloomberg Philanthropies](https://www.bloomberg.org/) where they focus on five key areas for creating lasting change: the arts, education, the environment, government innovation, and public health.

### Company feedback on us

Once a year we ask all our founders to do a short anonymous survey to give us feedback on what we can do better. We calculate a Net Promoter Score as part of this. We use that NPS as the most important metric to drive our fund's choices.

We would share our Net Promoter Score here, but we don’t want our founders to feel we are using their feedback to market ourselves. (Though we’d be happy to tell you in person.)

Always be learning from your customers -- ours are founders.

## Contacting us

If your looking for investment please only contact us if you have a demonstrable product or unique IP that you can explain to us without an NDA. If we are interested we will contact you back and arrange a meeting. Our preference is face-to-face at your location or somewhere in London, we always buy the coffees :)
