## About Us

We are a small group of angel investors based in London investing in early stage technology companies. Collectively we are experienced across product management, finance, recruitment, compliance and marketing. 

We are ‘hands-on by default’ investors and look to allocate our time as well as capital to all deals to ensure we can maximize the chance of success for all shareholders. If your looking solely for passive investors then we would not be a good fit. 

## Portfolio and Exits.

We have invested in the following companies since 2016. In most of them we have invested across multiple rounds.

## What we look for in a startup

### Themes

We are currently hot on the following investment themes:

Practical use of machine learning / narrow AI to support or re-engineer existing B2B workflows.

Novel techniques in matching buyers and sellers together to create new marketplaces.

Products to support the move towards digital health.

<...> As A Service.

### Founders

Whilst the idea is obviously important we are looking for a founding team that is even greater than the idea itself. We are fully aware that the concept might change (aka pivot) during the early stages so we are looking for traits in the team that give us confidence they can navigate through difficult times as well as demonstrating complimentary skillsets across team memebers. The perfect founding team would be one that combines deep technical prowess, strong business development /  sales capabilities along with understanding of how to operationally run a business.  

### Due Diligence Pack

Its important that you have a due diligence Pack ready to send us if your initial investor presentation got us interested. This should, at the very least, include: Full financials since company incorporation as well as a reasonable forward looking projections based on assumptions, full detail of previous rounds of funding and cap table. If you have it then a term sheet and shareholders agreement would be good but not critical for initial contact. 

## Contacting us

If you’re looking for investment please contact us if you have a demonstrable product or unique IP that you can explain to us without an NDA. If we are interested, we will contact you back and arrange a meeting. Our preference is face-to-face at your location or somewhere in London.
